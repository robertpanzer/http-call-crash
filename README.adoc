== Reproducer for segmentation fault in Envoy wasm

1. Build filter
+
----
bazel build :filter.wasm
----
2. Start current envoy-wasm (commit f6d0282f7ab42dfd215ae59112edbab3e70f2d3b) with the included configuration
+
----
envoy -c envoy.yaml
----
3. Send a request to Envoy:
+

curl localhost:8888 -Hwithheader:yes
----

Conditions under which Envoy does not segfault:

1. Don't send any headers with the httpCall:

curl localhost:8888

2. Change the FQDN of externalserver in the envoy.yaml to a name that can be resolved via DNS
